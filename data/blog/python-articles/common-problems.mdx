# DATABASE CONNECTION SEEM HIJACKED AFTER PYTHON SCRIPTS EXECUTE

I observed that after I wrote and execute script in python that connects to database to execute a query, my usual operations on database using sql editor did not yield a response, when I closed python execution windows, that’s when I got the response back from database. That made me believe I hadn’t done all the right things still, and closing just the cursor wasn’t enough, I avoided this problem using System.exit(0), however I knew that’s not how ideally its supposed to be. I learnt using the following to safely close connections in addition to system.exit(0)

- cursor.close() – Closes the database cursor that holds that data to query written, you can create multiple cursors on same connection
- del cursor() – Deletes the cursor
- con.close() – Closes connection, it is always advisable to create one connection and reuse by creating multiple cursors as a connection is expensive
